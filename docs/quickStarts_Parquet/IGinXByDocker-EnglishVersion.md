# IGinX Installation and Use Manual (By Docker)

IGinX is an open source polystore system. A polystore system provides an integrated data management service over a set of one or more potentially heterogeneous database/storage engines, serving heterogeneous workloads.

Currently, IGinX directly supports big data service over relational database PostgreSQL, time series databases InfluxDB/IoTDB/TimescaleDB/OpenTSDB, and Parquet data files.

## Environment Installation

### Java Installation

Since ZooKeeper, IGinX are all developed using Java, Java needs to be installed first. If a running environment of JDK >= 1.8 has been installed locally, **skip this step entirely**.

1. First, visit the [official Java website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/javase-jdk8-downloads.html) to download the JDK package for your current system.

2. Installation

```shell
$ cd ~/Downloads
$ tar -zxf jdk-8u181-linux-x64.gz # unzip files
$ mkdir /opt/jdk
$ mv jdk-1.8.0_181 /opt/jdk/
```

3. Set the path

Edit the ~/.bashrc file and add the following two lines at the end of the file:

```shell
export JAVA_HOME = /usr/jdk/jdk-1.8.0_181
export PATH=$PATH:$JAVA_HOME/bin
```

Load the file with the changed configuration (into shell scripts):

```shell
$ source ~/.bashrc
```

4. Use java -version to determine whether JDK installed successfully.

```shell
$ java -version
java version "1.8.0_181"
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_181-b13)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.181-b13, mixed mode)
```

If the words above are displayed, it means the installation was successful.

### Maven Installation

Maven is a build automation tool used primarily to build and managa Java projects. If you need to compile from the source code, you also need to install a Maven environment >= 3.6. Otherwise, **skip this step entirely**.

1. Visit the [official website](http://maven.apache.org/download.cgi)to download and unzip Maven

```shell
$ wget http://mirrors.hust.edu.cn/apache/maven/maven-3/3.3.9/binaries/apache-maven-3.3.9-bin.tar.gz
$ tar -xvf  apache-maven-3.3.9-bin.tar.gz
$ sudo mv -f apache-maven-3.3.9 /usr/local/
```

2. Set the path

Edit the ~/.bashrc file and add the following two lines at the end of the file:

```shell
export MAVEN_HOME=/usr/local/apache-maven-3.3.9
export PATH=${PATH}:${MAVEN_HOME}/bin
```

Load the file with the changed configuration (into shell scripts):

```shell
$ source ~/.bashrc
```

3. Type mvn -v to determine whether Maven installed successfully.

```shell
$ mvn -v
Apache Maven 3.6.1 (d66c9c0b3152b2e69ee9bac180bb8fcc8e6af555; 2019-04-05T03:00:29+08:00)
```

If the words above are displayed, that means the installation was successful.

### Docker installation

Docker provides an official installation script that allows users to automatically install it by entering the command:

```shell
$ curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com | bash -s docker --mirror Aliyun
```

You can also use the internal daocloud one-click installation command:

```shell
$ curl -sSL https://get.daocloud.io/docker | sh
```

Run this command to start the docker engine and check the docker version:

```shell
$ systemctl start docker
$ docker version
```

If the words above are displayed, it means the installation was successful:

```shell

## Compile the Image

Currently, the docker image of IGinX needs to be manually installed locally. First, you need to download the IGinX source code:

```shell
$ cd ~
$ git clone git@github.com:IGinX-THU/IGinX.git # Pull the latest IGinX code
$ cd IGinX
```

Then start building the IGinX image:

Currently, there are two types of IGinX image construction:
- oneShot: All dependencies including ZooKeeper, IGinX can be packaged and run with one shot.
- onlyIginx: Another way is to build the IGinX image separately, requiring the user to manually start the ZooKeeper service externally.

## oneShot

In this method, ZooKeeper and IGinX run as 2 separate containers with a custom network bridge which enables IGinX to communicate with ZooKeeper.

Before building the image, the params in `conf/config.properties` need to be changed. The IP address for ZooKeeper should be changed to the hostnames of ZooKeeper container. Otherwise, IGinX will not be able to access it.

```properties
# ZooKeeper hostname: zkServer
zookeeperConnectionString=zkServer:2181
```

Hostname for Zookeeper container can be changed in `$IGINX_HOME/docker/oneShot-parquet/docker-compose.yaml`：

```yaml
services:
  zookeeper:
    hostname: "custom_zookeeper_hostname"	#default: zkServer
# conf/config.properties should be changed accordingly
```

Then use the following command to build image and run:

```shell
$ cd docker/oneShot
$ ./build_and_run_iginx_docker.sh
```

The following words are displayed to indicate that the image was built and run successfully:

After this step, 127.0.0.1:10001 will be accessable for IGinX service.

**Warning: Before starting to build the IGinX image, you need to modify the network address parameters in IGinX. All "127.0.0.1" should be replaced by "host.docker.internal" to enable the IGinX container to communicate with ZooKeeper service that runs on host machine.**

```shell
$ cd docker/onlyIginx
$ ./build_iginx_docker.sh

```

Then start to run the image.

Start Zookeeper first:

```shell
$ cd ${zookeeper_path}
$ ./bin/zkServer.sh start
```

Then, modify IGinX configuration file `$IGINX_HOME/conf/config.properties`:

1. IP for IGinX:

   a. If you are **not** giving the container a customized IP, fill with IP address of the host server.

   ```properties
   # example:
   ip:11.272.81.34
   ```

   b. If you are going to giving the container a customized IP, fill with this customized IP address.

   ```properties
   # example
   ip:172.34.1.2
   ```
2. IP for parquet server:

   a. If you want IGinX to start a parquet database service, IP for parquet database server should be the same as IP for IGinX.

   ```properties
   # example
   ip:11.272.81.34
   storageEngineList=11.272.81.34#6667#parquet#dir=/path/to/your/parquet#dummy_dir=/path/to/your/data#iginx_port=6888#has_data=false#is_read_only=false
   ```

   b. If you want to connect to a remote parquet server, use it's IP address.

   ```properties
   # example
   ip:11.272.81.34
   storageEngineList=11.272.83.2#6667#parquet#dir=/path/to/your/parquet#dummy_dir=/path/to/your/data#iginx_port=6888#has_data=false#is_read_only=false
   ```
3. IP for ZooKeeper service:

   You should use the real IP address of the host server that ZooKeeper service runs on. Or, if ZooKeeper runs as a container with IGinX containers in the same net bridge, you can choose ZooKeeper container's hostname instead.

   ```properties
   # example
   zookeeperConnectionString=11.272.81.34:2181
   ```

Finally, start IGinX to complete the startup of the entire system:

```shell
$ cd ${iginx_path}/docker/onlyIginx
$ ./run_iginx_docker.sh -n iginx0 -p 10001
# -n container name
# -p host port to cast
```

This command will expose the host's port 10001 as the communication interface with the IGinX cluster. You can start accessing IGinX through 127.0.0.1:10001.

We also provide optional CMD parameters `-c` and `-o` for users to customize how IGinX container would run:

```shell
# example
$ ./run_iginx_docker.sh -n iginx0 -p 10001 -c my/path/to/config -o myNetwork
# -n container name
# -p host port to cast
# [optional] -c absolute path to config file (default: "$IGINX_HOME/conf/config.properties")
#				(very helpful to keep different versions of configuration files)
# [optional] -o overlay network
#				(to connect different containers from different hosts)
```
