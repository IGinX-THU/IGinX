# IGinX Installation and Use Manual (By Docker)

IGinX is an open source polystore system. A polystore system provides an integrated data management service over a set of one or more potentially heterogeneous database/storage engines, serving heterogeneous workloads.

Currently, IGinX directly supports big data service over relational database PostgreSQL, time series databases InfluxDB/IoTDB/TimescaleDB/OpenTSDB, and Parquet data files.

## Environment Installation

### Java Installation

Since ZooKeeper, IGinX and IoTDB are all developed using Java, Java needs to be installed first. If a running environment of JDK >= 1.8 has been installed locally, **skip this step entirely**.

1. First, visit the [official Java website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/javase-jdk8-downloads.html) to download the JDK package for your current system.

2. Installation

```shell
$ cd ~/Downloads
$ tar -zxf jdk-8u181-linux-x64.gz # unzip files
$ mkdir /opt/jdk
$ mv jdk-1.8.0_181 /opt/jdk/
```

3. Set the path

Edit the ~/.bashrc file and add the following two lines at the end of the file:

```shell
export JAVA_HOME = /usr/jdk/jdk-1.8.0_181
export PATH=$PATH:$JAVA_HOME/bin
```

Load the file with the changed configuration (into shell scripts):

```shell
$ source ~/.bashrc
```

4. Use java -version to determine whether JDK installed successfully.

```shell
$ java -version
java version "1.8.0_181"
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_181-b13)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.181-b13, mixed mode)
```

If the words above are displayed, it means the installation was successful.

### Maven Installation

Maven is a build automation tool used primarily to build and managa Java projects. If you need to compile from the source code, you also need to install a Maven environment >= 3.6. Otherwise, **skip this step entirely**.

1. Visit the [official website](http://maven.apache.org/download.cgi)to download and unzip Maven

```shell
$ wget http://mirrors.hust.edu.cn/apache/maven/maven-3/3.3.9/binaries/apache-maven-3.3.9-bin.tar.gz
$ tar -xvf  apache-maven-3.3.9-bin.tar.gz
$ sudo mv -f apache-maven-3.3.9 /usr/local/
```

2. Set the path

Edit the ~/.bashrc file and add the following two lines at the end of the file:

```shell
export MAVEN_HOME=/usr/local/apache-maven-3.3.9
export PATH=${PATH}:${MAVEN_HOME}/bin
```

Load the file with the changed configuration (into shell scripts):

```shell
$ source ~/.bashrc
```

3. Type mvn -v to determine whether Maven installed successfully.

```shell
$ mvn -v
Apache Maven 3.6.1 (d66c9c0b3152b2e69ee9bac180bb8fcc8e6af555; 2019-04-05T03:00:29+08:00)
```

If the words above are displayed, that means the installation was successful.

### Docker installation

Docker provides an official installation script that allows users to automatically install it by entering the command:

```shell
$ curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com | bash -s docker --mirror Aliyun
```

You can also use the internal daocloud one-click installation command:

```shell
$ curl -sSL https://get.daocloud.io/docker | sh
```

Run this command to start the docker engine and check the docker version:

```shell
$ systemctl start docker
$ docker version
```

If the words above are displayed, it means the installation was successful:

## Compile the Image

Currently, the docker image of IGinX needs to be manually installed locally. First, you need to download the IGinX source code:

```shell
$ cd ~
$ git clone git@github.com:IGinX-THU/IGinX.git # Pull the latest IGinX code
$ cd IGinX
```

Then start building the IGinX image:

Currently, there are two types of IGinX image construction:
- oneShot: All dependencies including ZooKeeper, IGinX and IoTDB can be packaged and run with one shot.
- onlyIginx: Another way is to build the IGinX image separately, requiring the user to manually start the ZooKeeper and IoTDB nodes externally.

## oneShot

In this method, ZooKeeper, IoTDB and IGinX run as 3 separate containers with a custom network bridge which enables these three containers to communicate with each other.

Before building the image, the params in `conf/config.properties` need to be changed. The IP address for ZooKeeper and IoTDB should be changed to the hostnames of those containers. Otherwise, IGinX will not be able to access them.

```properties
# IoTDB:iotdb12 (param before the first #)
# ZooKeeper:zkServer
storageEngineList=iotdb12#6667#iotdb12#username=root#password=root#sessionPoolSize=20#has_data=false#is_read_only=false
zookeeperConnectionString=zkServer:2181
```

Hostnames for Zookeeper and IoTDB containers can be changed in `$IGINX_HOME/docker/oneShot/docker-compose.yaml`

```yaml
services:
  zookeeper:
    hostname: "custom_zookeeper_hostname"	#default: zkServer
  iotdb:
    hostname: "custom_IoTDB_hostname"		#default: iotdb12
# conf/config.properties should be changed accordingly
```

Then use the following command to build image and run:

```shell
$ cd docker/oneShot
$ ./build_and_run_iginx_docker.sh
```

The following words are displayed to indicate that the image was built and run successfully:

After this step, 127.0.0.1:10001 will be accessable for IGinX service.

## onlyIginx

**Warning: Before starting to build the IGinX image, you need to modify the network address parameters in IGinX. All "127.0.0.1" should be replaced by "host.docker.internal" to enable the IGinX container to communicate with ZooKeeper, database services that run on host machine.**

Use the following command to build the IGinX image:

```shell
$ cd docker/onlyIginx
$ ./build_iginx_docker.sh
```

```

Then start to run the image.
Considering that IGinX and ZooKeeper communicates through network, it is necessary to establish a Docker network bridge to allow them to be interconnected through the network. Here we create a network bridge called docker-cluster-iginx:

```shell
$ docker network create -d bridge --attachable --subnet 172.40.0.0/16 docker-cluster-iginx
# 172.40.0.0 refers to the bridge's ip. You can customize it if necessary. The ip address usually starts with 172.
```

Now start Zookeeper:

```shell
$ cd ${zookeeper_path}
$ ./bin/zkServer.sh start
```

And then start an IoTDB instance:

```shell
$ cd ${iotdb_path}
# ./sbin/start-server.sh
```

Finally, start IGinX to complete the startup of the entire system:

```shell
$ cd ${iginx_path}/docker/onlyIginx
$ ./run_iginx_docker.sh x.x.x.x 10000
# x.x.x.x is the ip address IGinX container would use. It should be accessable to docker-cluster-iginx. You can use 172.40.0.2 for example. Note that 172.40.0.1 is the gateway and cannot be used here.
# 10000 refers to the port on host that can be used to access IGinX service. You can customize it if preferred.
```

This command will expose the localhost port 10000 as the communication interface with the IGinX cluster. You can start accessing IGinX through 127.0.0.1:10000.
