# The IGinX Polystore System

[IGinX](https://github.com/IGinX-THU/IGinX) is an open source polystore system. A polystore system provides an integrated data management service over a set of one or more potentially heterogeneous database/storage engines, serving heterogeneous workloads.

## Overview

IGinX (Intelligent enGine X) aims to facilitate users in profiting from their data assets that might spread across various storage/database engines. Evolving from the open source project [IginX](https://github.com/thulab/IginX), IGinX once was designed to manage the huge volume of time series data across a wide *End*-*Edge*-*Cloud* architecture and succeeded in [breaking the TPCx-IoT records in 2021](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-94437-7_2). However, profiting from data assets requires the interplay of various data types. Many users have their data spread across different database/storage engines. And, "No one size fits all". Properly matching data with storage engines can give users orders of magnitude in performance advantage. These motivations led to the decision of evolving IGinX. Thanks to its open and flexible architecture, IGinX can evolve into a polystore system without the need of complete redesign or reimplementation.

## Installation
