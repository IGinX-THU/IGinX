Apply a function along an axis of the DataFrame.

Objects passed to the function are Series objects whose index is either the DataFrame’s index (axis=0) or the
DataFrame’s columns (axis=1). By default, (result_type=None), the final return type is inferred from the return type
of the applied function. Otherwise, it depends on the result_type argument.
